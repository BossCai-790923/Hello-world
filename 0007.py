
# Step 0) I define a list variable my_list, this is to hold all numbers from user.
my_list = []

# Step 1) this is to store number input from console from user
new_number_str = input("Next number:")


# Step 2) I loop until new_number_str is 'exit'
while 'exit' != new_number_str:

    # Step 2.1) I convert the str new_number_str to int variable new_number
    new_number = int(new_number_str)

    # Step 2.2) I need to find the correct place where I should insert the new_number into my_list
    # Initially, I set new_number_index to 0, which means I insert new_number at index 0 of my_list
    new_number_index = 0

    # Step 2.3) I loop my_list
    #           I increase new_number_index as long as number is smaller than new_number, which means I need to loop
    #           until I find a number bigger than new_number, that's where I should insert new_number into my_list
    for number in my_list:
        if number < new_number:
            new_number_index += 1
        else:
            break

    # Step 2.4) Insert new_number to my_list at place - new_number_index
    my_list.insert(new_number_index, new_number)
    print(my_list)


    # Step 2.5) Update loop condition: Read next number from user
    new_number_str = input("Next number:")
